This document describes the variables inside `tidySet.txt`.
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity was captured at a constant rate of 50Hz. 

* Subjects: Individual Subject identifier.
* Activity: Activity performed when collecting this data.
* Features: Following features were generated from the accelerometer and gyroscope for each subject
**tBodyAcc-XYZ
**tGravityAcc-XYZ
**tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
**tBodyGyro-XYZ
**tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
**tBodyAccMag
**tGravityAccMag
**tBodyAccJerkMag
**tBodyGyroMag
**tBodyGyroJerkMag
**fBodyAcc-XYZ
**fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
**fBodyGyro-XYZ
**fBodyAccMag
**fBodyAccJerkMag
**fBodyGyroMag
**fBodyGyroJerkMag

*For each of the above following values are calculated
**mean(): Mean value
**std(): Standard deviation
